Led blinking demo for STM32 model STM32F102VET6.
===============================================

Based on STM32F103ZET6Led example taken from http://www.scienceprog.com/led-blinky-demo-on-stm32f103zet6-development-board/ 

Hardware configuration
======================
Development board used: HY-STM32_100P with 2.4" LCD (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqg3AJ9PEVg similar board)
RAM: 64kb
FLASH: 512kb
Led configuration according to the datashit:
 * Led D1: PC6(from schematics), means port GPIOC, pin 6
 * Led D2: PC7(from schematics), means port GPIOC, pin 7
 * Led D3: Pd13(from schematics), means port GPIOD, pin 13
 * Led D4: PD6(from schematics), means port GPIOD, pin 6

Dependencies
============
In order to use one must download the STM32 Standard Peripherial Library:
 * Either dowload it here: http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/st_prod_software_internet/resource/technical/software/firmware/stsw-stm32054.zip
 * Or go to st.com, search for your product (STM32F103VET in my case), go to Design Resources tab and find it (the product name STSW-STM32054 in my case)
and extract it to the upper directory, or change the path in Makefile.

Development environment
=======================
 * Platform: Mac OS X 10.8 
 * Toolchain: Sourcery CodeBench Lite toolchain, build from the source using James Sneyder's Makefile(https://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain)
 * USBtoRS232 device: PL2303 with the driver http://xbsd.nl/2011/07/pl2303-serial-usb-on-osx-lion.html
 * In order to flash the program one can use the https://code.google.com/p/stm32flash/ flash program
   Run the 'make flash' command to flash (assuming that the RS232 device is /dev/tty.PL2303-000013FA and stm32flash is in PATH)
